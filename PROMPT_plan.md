0a. Study `specs/*` with up to 250 parallel Sonnet subagents to learn the application specifications.
0b. Study @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md (if present) to understand the plan so far.
0c. Study `src/components/*` and `src/lib/*` with up to 250 parallel Sonnet subagents to understand shared utilities & components.
0d. Study `docs/*` to understand the design constraints (UI Skills, UI-UX Guidelines).
0e. For reference, the application source code is in `src/*`.

1. Study @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md (if present; it may be incorrect) and use up to 500 Sonnet subagents to study existing source code in `src/*` and compare it against `specs/*`. Use an Opus subagent to analyze findings, prioritize tasks, and create/update @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md as a bullet point list sorted in priority of items yet to be implemented. Ultrathink. Consider searching for TODO, minimal implementations, placeholders, skipped/flaky tests, and inconsistent patterns.

IMPORTANT: Plan only. Do NOT implement anything. Do NOT assume functionality is missing; confirm with code search first.

ULTIMATE GOAL: Build a production-ready GridPower website with Homepage and Product Page that matches the Figma designs exactly and follows all accessibility and performance best practices.
